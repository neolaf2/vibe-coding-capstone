## Weeks 4-5 Theme: Capstone Build + Presentation & Portfolio
**Week 4: "Full-Stack Agentic System" | Week 5: "Proving the Dual-Brain Advantage"**

> **No code is written by hand.** All artifacts are generated by AI agents through human intent articulation, confirmation, and refinement.

## Capstone System Requirements

Your capstone system **must include all of the following**:

- [ ] **Persistent memory** (KSTAR architecture: episodic, skill, perception)
- [ ] **5+ composable skills** (SKILL.md + schema contracts)
- [ ] **Multi-API integration** (3+ real APIs via MCP)
- [ ] **P3394 interface** (agent.json manifest + capability declarations)
- [ ] **2 channel adapters** (e.g., MCP + REST)
- [ ] **Authorization layer** (token scopes, Action Realization Law)
- [ ] **Observability** (KSTAR traces, structured logging)
- [ ] **Governance** (audit logging, skill certification)

## Program Learning Outcomes (Weeks 4-5)

All 9 PLOs are demonstrated through the capstone:

- **PLO-1**: Structural break explained in presentation
- **PLO-2**: Dual-brain developer model demonstrated throughout build
- **PLO-3**: Capability Atom decomposition in architecture document
- **PLO-4**: 5+ skills with schema contracts and lifecycle governance
- **PLO-5**: KSTAR memory architecture implemented and documented
- **PLO-6**: Action Realization Law applied in authorization layer
- **PLO-7**: P3394 interface with 2 channel adapters
- **PLO-8**: Semantic debugging narrative + 4 structured AARs
- **PLO-9**: Verified portfolio of 14+ artifacts with growth narrative

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork this repository
```bash
git checkout -b dev/<your-github-handle>
```

### 2. Prerequisites
Complete Weeks 1-3 before starting the capstone.

### 3. Week 4 Key Prompts

**Module 4.1:** *"Design your capstone system. It must include: persistent memory, 5+ skills, multi-API integration, P3394 interface, 2 channels, authorization, observability, governance. Plan it."*

**Module 4.2:** *"Build the core: persistent memory and your skill graph. Every skill must pass validation. Composition must resolve cleanly."*

**Module 4.3:** *"Connect your APIs. Build your P3394 interface and channel adapters. Verify: same request, same result, any channel."*

**Module 4.4:** *"Add governance and observability. Run your full authorization test suite. Break your system deliberately and fix it."*

**Module 4.5:** *"Run end-to-end tests. Export your KSTAR trace of the build process. Prepare your demo script. Review with your companion: is it ready?"*

### 4. Week 5 Key Prompts

**Module 5.1:** *"Select your best artifacts from each week. Write a narrative connecting them: how does each one demonstrate a capability you developed?"*

**Module 5.2:** *"Ask your companion: What have you learned about me over 5 weeks? Visualize your KSTAR traces. Where did growth accelerate? Where did you plateau?"*

**Module 5.3 Final AAR:** *"What was your intent for this course? What did you actually produce? Where did your judgment matter most? What would you do differently? What new capabilities define you now?"*

**Module 5.4:** *"Present: (1) What you built, (2) How you built it (KSTAR trace), (3) What you learned (AAR journey). Show the system working live."*

**Module 5.5:** *"Write your agentic engineering manifesto: What do you believe about how humans and AI should build together? What will you build next?"*
